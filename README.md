# Language Technologies in Practice Final Project - Sarcasm Detection
  
As the purpose of this course is to realize how different things can be in a real life setting, this project attempts to tackle a problem that will be useful in a real life context.
Namely, sarcasm detection. There are various use cases for this, among them more accurate evaluation of feedback/reviews.

Additionally, not only modern approaches are tried to tackle this problem.
The approaches used for tackling this task are:
  
* Naive TF/IDF vectorization techniques
* Word embedding vectorization techniques
* Deep transfer learning techniques
 
All of these provide different advantages and an *overall* winner will be picked as a go to approach depending on the available resources.
